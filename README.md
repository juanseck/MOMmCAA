This is the multiobjective version of a recent metaheuristic algorithm that optimizes a single objective function, known as the Majority-minority Cellular Automata Algorithm (MmCAA, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117379), inspired by cellular automata operation. The MOMmCAA adds repository management and multiobjective search space density control to complement the performance of the MmCAA and make it capable of optimizing multiobjective problems.
